🧠 The Archive – BrainDumps
Ever had a thought so random, so oddly specific, so existential at 2:37 AM that you felt the overwhelming urge to write it down? Welcome to The Archive – a little corner of the internet made for dumping exactly those brain spirals.

This isn’t a serious blog. It’s not a journal. It’s a repository of thought glitches, mental ramblings, and philosophical what-ifs — all dressed up with a clean UI and a slightly sarcastic backend.

💡 What even is this?
The Archive is a full-stack blogging app for overthinkers, midnight philosophers, and anyone who’s ever stared at their ceiling fan and wondered, “Am I real?”

It lets you:
🖊️ Write blogs (a.k.a. brain dumps)
🌐 View them via neat URLs like /blog/its-the-simulation
🎨 Scroll through clean, comfy UI animations and styles
🧠 Store thoughts in MongoDB like the data-hoarding goblins we are

⚙️ Built With
🧩 React (because obviously)
🐒 Express + MongoDB (for the backend brain)
🖌️ TailwindCSS + LottieFiles (because vibes)
🚀 Vite (for speed, duh)
🕸️ Axios (to glue frontend + backend like superglue)

🗂 Folder Structure
/client         # Frontend – where the thoughts come to life
/server         # Backend – where the thoughts go to rest (aka get stored)

🚧 Work in Progress
Authentication? Maybe.

Write blog from UI? Eventually.

Search? Sorting? Tags? Who knows. Depends on the next overthinking spiral.

Still here? Go read a blog. (lemme deploy it though)
